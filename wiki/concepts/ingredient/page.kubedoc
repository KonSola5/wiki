This page was created with KubeJS 7.2 (for 1.21.1) in mind. Most of the information you see here will work with your version as well, but code syntax especially might *slightly* differ across versions.

We are working on creating alternate versions of this page for other versions of Minecraft.

An `Ingredient` is a filter over items that is used to determine which item stacks are valid inputs for a given recipe. In their most basic form, they can either match a single item, an item tag, or any combination of the previous two (as a list). Additionally, more complex ingredients exist that allow filtering by creative tab or mod name, or let you subtract one ingredient from another, as elaborated on below.

>>> info
Ingredients are **unstacked** by default, though NeoForge provides a `SizedIngredient` to fill that gap. SizedIngredients use the same syntax as ingredients, though additionally support a stack size (see [[/concepts/item-stack|`ItemStack`]] as well) during parsing.

# Creating Ingredients
KubeJS will automatically try to *wrap* any input to an ingredient in places where it is expected, but you can also use the `Ingredient` wrapper ([source](https://github.com/KubeJS-Mods/KubeJS/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/latvian/mods/kubejs/plugin/builtin/wrapper/IngredientWrapper.java)) to explicitly create them yourself, specifically using the method `[js]Ingredient.of(input)`:

## Simple Ingredients
Most simple ingredient types may simply be written as string literals.
- `''` (empty string), `'-'`, `air` and `minecraft:air` will return an ingredient that matches nothing, while `'*'` returns one that matches anything.
- Any item ID will create an Ingredient that matches that specific item (ignoring data).
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('minecraft:apple')`
- Any ID beginning with a `#` will match the tag with the given name, for example `'#c:ingots/iron'` will match all iron ingots.
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('#c:ingots/copper')`

Tag ingredients are not available in startup scripts!

- An item ID followed by a **component filter** (using the same syntax as [`/give`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Argument_types#item_stack)) creates an ingredient that matches that item with the given components
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('minecraft:diamond_sword[damage=2]')`
- `'@modid'` will match all items added by the mod with the given mod ID
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('@create')`
- `%` followed by an ID will match any items contained in the creative tab with that ID
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('%minecraft:building_blocks')`
- A regular expression (either using the JavaScript regex syntax or as a string) will match all items where the ID matches that regex.
	- Examples:
	- `[js]Ingredient.of(/minecraft:(gold|iron)_ingot/)`
	- `[js]Ingredient.of('/minecraft:(gold|iron)_ingot/')`
	- Both of these will match both Gold and Iron Ingots.

## Sized ingredients
You can create sized ingredients from regular ones by either:
- in string syntax - prepending the ingredient with an integer number and a letter `x`.
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('2x minecraft:apple')`
- using `[js]Ingredient.of(ingredient, count)`
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('minecraft:apple', 2)`
- or by using the `withSize` method on ingredients.
	- Example: `[js]Ingredient.of('minecraft:apple').withSize(2)`

## Compound Ingredients
As mentioned above, Ingredients may also be *nested* by using lists, which means that for example,
```js
[
	'minecraft:apple',      // either an apple
	'#c:ingots/copper',     // OR any copper ingot
	'@create',              // OR any item added by Create
  '-'                     // OR nothing, which does... nothing
]
```
and:
```js
Ingredient.of('[minecraft:apple, #c:ingots/copper, @create, -]')
```
are valid syntaxes and will match any item that fulfills ANY of these conditions.

Additionally, if you want to create an `[js]Ingredient` that needs to match **multiple** conditions, you can use the method `[js]ingredient.and(other)` on an existing ingredient to create a so-called `IntersectionIngredient`: `[js]Ingredient.of('#c:ingots').and('@create')` for example will match any ingots that have been added by Create.

Similarly, `[js]ingredient.except(other)` can be used on an ingredient to create a `SubtractionIngredient`, i.e. an ingredient that matches all items from the first ingredient that are NOT contained in the second ingredient. In the above example, replacing `and` with `except` would thus match any ingot NOT added by Create.

# Using Ingredients

>>> danger
Ingredients are **lazily resolved** and will cache their results once tested.  
For this reason, we do __not__ allow using Ingredient in contexts where ItemStack is expected!

## Useful Methods

- `[js]ingredient.and(other)`:
  - `other` - Another ingredient.
  - **Returns**: An ingredient accepting items that match both this ingredient and `other`.
- `[js]ingredient.or(other)`: 
  - `other` - Another ingredient.
  - **Returns**: An ingredient accepting items that match this ingredient or `other`.
- `[js]ingredient.except(other)`:
  - `other` - Another ingredient.
  - **Returns**: An ingredient accepting items that match this ingredient, but not `other`.
- `[js]ingredient.withCount(count)`
  - `count` - An integer specifying count of the ingredient.
  - **Returns**: a `SizedIngredient` of this ingredient with the given count
- `[js]ingredient.asStack()`
  - **Returns**: a `SizedIngredient` of size 1, equivalent to `[js]ingredient.withCount(1)`
- `[js]ingredient.test(item)`:
  - `item`: The `ItemStack` to test whether it is a part of the ingredient.
  - **Returns**: `true` if the provided item stack matches this ingredient, `false` otherwise. **This resolves the ingredient!**
- `[js]ingredient.getItems()`
- `[js]ingredient.getStackArray()`
  - **Returns**: An array of all ItemStacks that match the ingredient. **This resolves the ingredient!**
