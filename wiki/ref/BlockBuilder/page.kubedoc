---
## $$.mapColor(value: MapColor)
#[[red|(1.20.1+ only)]]
Set block map color.
---
## $$.soundType(value: SoundType)
#[[red|(1.20.1+ only)]]
Set block sound type. You can also use one of these shortcut methods:

- $$.noSoundType()
- $$.woodSoundType()
- $$.stoneSoundType()
- $$.gravelSoundType()
- $$.grassSoundType()
- $$.sandSoundType()
- $$.cropSoundType()
- $$.glassSoundType()
---
## $$.property(value: BlockProperty)
Adds more blockstates to the block, like being waterlogged or facing a certain direction.
---
## $$.tagBlock(value: ID)
Adds a tag to the block, e.g `'namespace:tag_name'`
---
## $$.tagItem(value: ID)
Adds a tag to the block's item, if it has one, e.g `'forge:storage_blocks/iron'`
---
## $$.tagBoth(value: ID)
Adds both block and item tag if possible, e.g `'minecraft:planks'`
---
## $$.hardness(value: float)
Sets the block's Hardness value. Used for calculating the time it takes for the block to be destroyed.
---
## $$.resistance(value: float)
Set's the block's resistance to things like explosions
---
## $$.unbreakable()
Shortcut to set the resistance to MAX\_VALUE and hardness to -1 (like bedrock)
---
## $$.lightLevel(value: float)
Sets the block's light level (0 - 1).
---
## $$.opaque(value: boolean)
Sets whether the block is opaque. Full, opaque blocks will not let light through.
---
## $$.fullBlock(value: boolean)
Sets whether the block renders as a full block. Full blocks have certain optimizations applied to them, such as not rendering terrain behind them. If you're using `.box()` to make a custom hitbox, please set this to `false`.
---
## $$.requiresTool(value: boolean)
If `true`, the block will use certain block tags to determine whether it should drop an item when mined. For example, a block tagged with `#minecraft:mineable/axe`, `#minecraft:mineable/pickaxe`, and `#minecraft:needs_iron_tool` would drop nothing unless it was mined with an axe or pickaxe that was at least iron level.
---
## $$.renderType(value: RenderType)
Sets the render type.
---
## $$.color(tintIndex: int, color: Color)
Recolors a block to a certain color
---
## $$.textureAll(value: ID)
Textures all 6 sides of the block to the same texture.
The path must look like `kubejs:block/texture_name` (which would be included under `kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/block/texture_name.png`).
Defaults to `kubejs:block/<block_name>`
---
## $$.texture(side: Direction, texture: ID)
Texture one side by itself.
---
## $$.model(value: ID)
Specify a custom model.
The path must look like `'kubejs:block/texture_name'` (which would be included under `kubejs/assets/kubejs/models/block/texture_name.png`).
Defaults to `'kubejs:block/<block_name>'`.
---
## $$.noItem()
Removes the associated item. Minecraft does this by default for a few blocks, like nether portal blocks. Use this if the player should never be able to hold or place the block.
---
## $$.box(x0: float, y0: float, z0: float, x1: float, y1: float, z1: float, scale16?: boolean)
scale16 boolean defaults to true.
Sets a custom hitbox for the block, affecting collision. You can use this multiple times to define a complex shape composed of multiple boxes.
Each box is a rectangular prism with corners at (x0, y0, z0) and (x1, y1, z1)
You will probably want to set up a custom block model that matches the shape you define here.
The final boolean determines the coordinate scale of the box. Passing in `true` will use the numbers 0-16, while passing in `false` will use coordinates ranging from 0 to 1
---
## $$.noCollision()
Removes the default full-block hitbox, allowing you to fall through the block.
---
## $$.notSolid()
Tells the renderer that the block isn't solid.
---
## $$.waterlogged()
Allows the block to be waterloggable.
---
## $$.noDrops()
The block will not drop itself, even if mined with silk touch.
---
## $$.slipperiness(value: float)
Sets the slipperiness of the block. Affects how much entities slide while moving on it. Almost every block in Vanilla has a slipperiness value of 0.6, except slime (0.8) and ice (0.98).
---
## $$.speedFactor(value: float)
A modifier affecting how quickly players walk on the block.
---
## $$.jumpFactor(value: float)
A modifier affecting how high players can jump off the block.
---
## $$.randomTick(callback: Consumer<RandomTickEvent>)
A function to run when the block recieves a random tick.
---
## $$.item(item: Consumer<ItemBuilder>)
Modify certain properties of the block's item.
See [[/tutorials/item-registry]] for more info.
---
## $$.setLootTableJson(value: json)
Pass in a custom loot table JSON directly
---
## $$.setBlockstateJson(value: json)
Pass in a custom blockstate JSON directly
---
## $$.setModelJson(value: json)
Pass in a custom model JSON directly
---
## $$.noValidSpawns(value: boolean)
If `true`, the block is not counted as a valid spawnpoint for entities
---
## $$.suffocating(value: boolean)
Whether the block will suffocate entities that have their head inside it
---
## $$.viewBlocking(value: boolean)
Whether the block counts as blocking a player's view.
---
## $$.redstoneConductor(value: boolean)
Sets whether the block will conduct redstone. True by default.
---
## $$.transparent(value: boolean)
Sets whether the block is transparent or not
---
## $$.defaultCutout()
Batches a bunch of methods to make blocks such as glass
---
## $$.defaultTranslucent()
similar to $$.defaultCutout() but using translucent layer instead
