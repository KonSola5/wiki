`HolderWrapper` is an interface used internally by KubeJS to convert strings and other JS objects into `Holder` and `HolderSet` instances.
It is not exposed to global scope, so only the type wrapper will be discussed here.

`Holder` instances hold references to registry objects of a given type. These are obtained from Minecraft registry lookups.
For example, `Holder<Item>` holds references to `Item` registry objects.

`HolderSet` instances are sets of `Holder` instances that hold references to registry objects of a given type.
For example, `HolderSet<Item>` is a set of `Holder<Item>` instances that hold references to `Item` registry objects.

# Wrapping to `Holder`

The following:
- strings and other Java character sequences,
- `ResourceLocation` instances,
- `ResourceKey` instances
all perform a registry lookup for the ID stored in them, and the result is a Holder of a target type that holds a reference to a registry object.

**Example**

When `[js]'minecraft:iron_pickaxe'` is passed into a method argument that expects a `Holder<Item>`, that function will receive a `Holder<Item>` that holds a reference to an `Item` which represents the Iron Pickaxe item.

# Wrapping to `HolderSet`

These objects can be converted to `HolderSet` directly by doing the following:
- `HolderSet`: kept as is,
- `Holder`: creates a one-element `HolderSet` with the `Holder` inside,
- `ResourceLocation` and strings representing resource locations, like `[js]'minecraft:iron_pickaxe'`: creates a flattened `HolderSet` with the `Holder` instances holding references to registry objects with the given resource location as its ID,
- [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), [`Pattern`]("https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html") and strings containing regex patterns (like `[js]'/minecraft:.*_wool/'`): Returns a `HolderSet` of all `Holders` of registry objects whose ID match the given regex,
- `TagKey` and strings representing tags (like `[js]'#minecraft:logs'`): Returns a `HolderSet` of all `Holders` of registry objects who are a part of a given tag,
- Strings representing mod IDs (like `[js]'@minecraft'`): Returns a `HolderSet` of all `Holders` of registry objects that match the namespace part of their ID,
- In all other cases, `[js]null` is returned.

If the object passed in is an JS array or any other Java iterable object, it is recursively flattened to produce the final `HolderSet`.

**Example**

When `[js]\['minecraft:iron_pickaxe', 'minecraft:diamond_pickaxe'\]` is passed into a method argument that expects a `HolderSet<Item>`, that function will receive a `HolderSet<Item>` that holds references to `Item` instances which represent respectively: the Iron Pickaxe and the Diamond Pickaxe.
