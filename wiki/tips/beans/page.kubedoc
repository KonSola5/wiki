KubeJS has a feature known as beans which allows you to make scripts a tad more readable.
Anything `[js]getXy()` can be gotten with `[js]xy`, anything `[js]setXy(value)` can be set with `[js]xy = value` and anything `[js]isXy()` can be checked with just `[js]xy`.
This allows us to shorten our code! For example, to get a list of all online players you can do: `[js]event.getServer().getPlayers()`. With beans this can be shortened to `[js]event.server.players`!

>>> warn
Note that `[js]get` and `[js]is` beans only work if the method has no parameters. This means a method like `[js]getHeldItem(InteractionHand hand)` cannot be shortened to `[js]heldItem`.
For `[js]set` the method needs to have a single parameter.
